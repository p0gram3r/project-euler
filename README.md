codingDojoJava
==============

This project can be used for coding dojo sessions for Java and Maven based katas. It contains a 
"Hello World!" example consisting of a simple class and a basic JUnit test and a basic *pom.xml* 
file. 

After cloning this project, execute `mvn clean test` to get all dependencies and run the unit 
tests.

Run `mvn cobertura:cobertura` to measure code coverage.

**HAPPY CODING :)**
